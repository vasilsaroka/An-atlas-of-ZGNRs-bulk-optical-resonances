# An-atlas-of-ZGNRs-bulk-optical-resonances


This is Mathematica and partially Python code to reproduce Figures of the paper "2N+4-rule and an atlas of bulk optical resonances of zigzag graphene nanoribbons".

<ol>
<li> Requirements:<br>
OS: The code was tested on Windows 7 and 10.<br>
Mathematica: Packages <a href="https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/9355/">MaTeX</a>  by Szabolcs Horv√°t and <a href="https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/Demos/5599/">CustomTicks</a> by Mark A. Caprio  are required.<br>
  The Mathematica code was developed in Mathematica 11.3 and 12.<br>
Python: The python script relies on scientific python software stack. The script uses packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, re, os and datetime.<br>
  The python script wad developed in Python 3.7.1
